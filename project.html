  <h1>Project Description</h1>
   <p style="font-size:18px;"> 
   My project investigates multiple profile maintenance on Instagram. Secondary private accounts, often known as finstas, often provide a venue for authenticity with an audience of strong ties. I am curious in how these accounts interact, and the behavior of followers on these accounts. More specifically, I am creating a visualization tool to aid the interview process and encourage conversation about potentially sensitive information participants may share. I am using web crawlers as well as visualization techniques to create this tool.
