I'm a rising senior majoring in Computer Science+Math with a minor in American Culture Studies at [Washington University in St. Louis][washu]. 
I plan to graduate in May 2020, and pursue a PhD in Computer Science with a focus in Human-Computer Interaction. 
I am generously supported by the [DREU program][dreu], where I am co-mentored by Ranjitha Kumar and Karrie Karahalios at the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign][uiuc].
