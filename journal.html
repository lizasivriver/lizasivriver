  <h1>Week 1</h1>
    <p style="font-size:18px;"> I am so thrilled to be here and gave myself time in the first week to not only explore Urbana and Champaign, but also adjust being back in the US after my semester abroad. I am really excited to live in a college town, which is something I’ve never done before!
      I started reading a variety of papers to familiarize myself with recent research in Human-Computer Interaction. I will be soft-mentored by a graduate student in the department and contribute to his project, and also be able to take ownership of another project of my choice. Karrie and Ranjitha gave me some resources on creating research questions and hypotheses to guide thinking about my own project.

  <h1>Week 2</h1>
   <p style="font-size:18px;"> My objective for this week was to refine my project topic for the summer. I really appreciate the opportunity to be able to choose my topic of research, but it’s honestly overwhelming because there’s so much interesting research to be done! I am starting to learn firsthand how independent research is -- you're not given a list of articles to read culminating in a clear assignment, but rather you choose what you think is necessary and take away what you think is important. In my initial research, I was drawn to topics of education and learning initially, but then became more interested in recent research about finstas and how this phenomenon relates to the idea of Multiple Profile Maintenance. After much finetuning, I will be conducting research with these research questions guiding me: Given that existing literature suggests that users create partitions between multiple profiles, how do users and their followers create links between public-facing accounts and secret accounts? How do an individual’s finsta and insta interact with each other (do they follow each other/do they use the accounts to increase each other’s like count)? 

Additionally, I researched the tools currently available to crawl and scrape data from Instagram, which is challenging considering the privacy concerns that come with the platform. I got the web scraper to work for public accounts, but am still facing challenges in getting the scraper to work for private accounts. 

     Outside of research, I've been enjoying hanging out with the undergrads in the lab and other people I'm meeting in Champaign. A highlight of my week was seeing the wonderfully hilarious and touching Booksmart in theaters. I also got the chance to check out the Urbana Farmer's Market as well as the public library here so I'm catching up on some pleasure reading too.
